# Predicting-Stock-Volatility-using-Financial-News-Sentiment-Analysis-
This is a project which I did during Winter in Data Science December-2025.This Project merges the fundamentals of Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) and Quantitative Finance Analytics.

 # Project Overview 
Financial markets react strongly to news good or bad. In this project, I collected news headlines and merged them with historical stock price data to study whether sentiment from financial news can help **predict future stock price volatility**.

I :
- Parsed financial news from online sources
- Preprocessed and analyzed text using sentiment tools
- Created features linking sentiment to market moves
- Built and evaluated prediction models

This helped me combine **text analytics** with **market data analysis**

## What I Learned

- Basics of **Python for data analysis**
- Parsing XML/RSS feeds
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning)
- Using sentiment analysis models like **VADER or FinBERT**
- Feature engineering and basic machine learning modeling
- Correlating textual sentiment with market returns and volatility
