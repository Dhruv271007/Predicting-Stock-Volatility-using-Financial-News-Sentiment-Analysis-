Up to the midterm stage, this project focuses on data collection, parsing, and integration. 
I collected financial news data from RSS/XML feeds and historical stock price data using APIs,
cleaned and structured both datasets, and aligned news sentiment with corresponding trading days.
This forms the foundation for later modeling and analysis.
